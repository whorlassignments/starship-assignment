        - The ship begins to smoothly accelerate in the way that
        - only starships can. The stars begin to rush by.
        - ""
        - But suddenly, the ship's engines cut out and the control
        - panel goes dark. The rest of the ship's power seems to be
        - on, but it would appear that there are some quirks that
        - the person you got this ship from didn't tell you about.
        - ""
        - Looking at the console, you notice some smoke coming from
        - behind a small door below the controls. You try to pry it
        - open using a small gap surrounding the door, but it doesn't
        - budge.
        - ""
        - There's a keypad next to the door. You press a few buttons,
        - but it's clearly broken. You are overwhelmed with the feeling
        - that, even though you don't know anything about starships,
        - you could fix it.
        - ""

        - "   * Multiplying by 3"
        - "   * Adding 6"
        - "   * Dividing by 3"
        - "   * Subtracting the original input"
        - ""
        - "Yeah, you can do this. You're sure."
